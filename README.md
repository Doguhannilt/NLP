# NLP

NLP (Natural Language Processing) enables computers to understand and generate human language. It has applications in speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification.


# Key steps in NLP:

1-) Text pre-processing: Cleaning and transforming raw text data for analysis.

2-) Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words or tokens.

3-) Stemming: Reducing words to their base form.

4-)Stopword removal: Removing common, uninformative words.

5-)Part-of-speech tagging: Assigning a grammatical tag to each word.


# NLP tasks:

I-) Sentiment analysis: Identifying sentiment in text (positive, negative, neutral).

II-) Text classification: Assigning categories or labels to text.

III-) Machine learning models: Support vector machines, logistic regression, neural networks.
